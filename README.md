# Final Project Comp 598: The Battle of Deep Learning Algorithms

# TODO

* Implement naive learners such as SVM, Random Forest, etc so we'll be able to compare them with our crazy DL algo
* Implement One Class SVM
* document feature pre-processing
* Implement RNN, CNN, and maybe DBN if we have the time
* Prepare slides for Wednesday?
* **Feel free to add or modify**
